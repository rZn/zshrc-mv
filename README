You can copy the zshrc file completely or partly, as you need.
Comments are welcome.

zshrc is a zsh initialization file (e.g. to be used as /etc/zshrc or ~/.zshrc)
which activates a lot of zsh interactive features. In particular, all of

https://github.com/hchbaw/auto-fu.zsh/
https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/
https://github.com/vaeth/set_prompt/
https://github.com/vaeth/termcolors-mv/

are initialized if available.
(For auto-fu.zsh use at least version 0.0.1.13 [only in git, branch pu].)

For gentoo, ebuilds for this and all above packages can be found
in the mv overlay (available via layman).

Concerning the colors which zshrc sets, you will only be happy if you
use a terminal with a black background (and the 256 colors are mainly
tested with xterm - with other terminals e.g. the highlighted colors
may look differently and maybe bad). My testing xresources for xterm contain:
	XTerm*cursorColor: green
	XTerm*background:  black
	XTerm*foreground:  white

Note that the zshrc file cares only about zsh specific features,
not about "standard" variables, aliases, or functions which you would
normally set in .profile, .bash_profile, or .bashrc:

In particular, PATH etc. are expected to be complete when zshrc is sourced.

Optionally, zshrc can source a separate file in which you can set things
like aliases, functions or CDPATH for interactive usage in bash syntax.
(You might want to source that separate file also from .bash_profile
or .bashrc in an interactive bash.)
If you want to make use of that feature, you must have set
	interactive=/path/to/bashrc_file_for_interactive_mode
when sourcing zshrc (or set it in the beginning of zshrc).

Also some other paths are configurable if you have set
	DEFAULTS=/path/to/local/configuration/files
when you source zshrc. More precisely, if you define DEFAULTS,
the following files are optionally used/included (if they exist):

$DEFAULTS/DIR_COLORS{,-256}
	These substitute /etc/DIR_COLORS{,-256} if available.
	Download e.g. from https://github.com/vaeth/termcolors-mv/

$DEFAULTS/zsh/completion/
	Can contain local zsh completion files

$DEFAULTS/zsh/auto-fu.zsh
	If no compiled auto-fu from https://github.com/hchbaw/auto-fu.zsh/
	is found in a global path, this is used as a fallback.

$DEFAULTS/zsh/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
	Fallback for https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/
